# Basic Flutter To Do App Todolender

**Todolender** is a todo project prepared with Flutter and used MVVM design pattern and Provider state management method. In this project I used [google_fonts 1.1.2](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) and [table_calendar 2.3.3](https://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar) packages. Also, I included the [CustomSlider](https://github.com/hakanbakacak/flutter-custom-page-slider) widget that I prepared before.
